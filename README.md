# WiiStation

WiiStation (formely WiiSXRX_2022), is a Sony PlayStation 1 (PS1/PSX/PSone) emulator, forked from the original WiiSX-RX (http://github.com/niuus/WiiSXRX) emulator by NiuuS, originally a port of PCSX-Reloaded, but with many changes from PCSX-ReARMed, for the Nintendo Wii/Wii U.

## The following changes have been made to the code based on WiiSXRX.

* Incorporating the CDROM and CDRISO codes from PCSX-ReARMed, the compatibility of the system has been greatly improved.
  Many games that could not be run or had problems before can be run now.

* CDDA (Compact Disc Digital Audio) tracks & multi-tracks support.

* Incorporating the timer codes from PCSX-ReARMed.

* Combined the DFSound module from PCSX-ReARMed and used the SDL library.
  The sound quality of the system has been greatly improved.

* Inclusing the new PSX dynamic recompiler [Lightrec](https://github.com/pcercuei/lightrec) by pcercuei, the speed/performance of the emulation is greatly improved. The old PPC dynarec, as well as the Interpreter core, are kept as an option in case of compatiblity change.

* Support for multiple languages.
  At first, I wanted to refer to Snes9x GX and support TTF font library.
  However, it encountered a memory leak problem, resulting in automatic exit.
  So it can only be made into a specific font.
  Font char information: first two byte: BigEndianUnicode char code, followed by a character picture in IA8 format with a size of 24 * 24.

* For some customized Chinese culture games, specific BIOS is automatically loaded.
  For example:  sd:\wiisxrx\isos\武藏传.ISO => sd:\wiisxrx\bios\武藏传.bin

* Other minor corrections, such as disc changing (swap) and automatic fixes (autoFix functions) for some games.

  ※※※ Note: It reads a font file in a fixed location, so make sure that [sd:/wiisxrx/fonts/chs.dat] exists ※※※

## Goals

(some taken from NiuuS' WiiSXRX readme)

* Improve GTE (Geometry Transformation Engine) code to provide 3D game speed.
  Although I used paired single instruction, the speed is basically not improved.

* Use the graphics display mode of GL to provide image quality and performance.
  I don't know anything about OpenGL, and I don't know if I can use grrlib.

* DualShock 3, DualShock 4 and DualShock 5 controller support.

* Possibility to select other BIOS with some basic buttons.

Any help is appreciated.

## Compilation information

* devkitPPC r41-2 + libOGC2 (until git [7456c4ab](https://github.com/extremscorner/libogc2/commit/7456c4abf3e8e8ccd7eac7bb7cbe808128befa55)) + SDL + GNU Lightning + Lightrec

  You can download devkitPPC r41-2 (and older versions) here: https://wii.leseratte10.de/devkitPro/

  The modified devkitPPC base rules and the compiled libOCG2, SDL, GNU Lightning and Lightrec libraries are here: https://github.com/xjsxjs197/WiiSXRX_2022/raw/main/lightrec+Libogc2.zip
