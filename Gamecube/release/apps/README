 * For SD/USB: Put ISOs (.bin/.cue or other formats) in the directory named /wiisxrx/isos,
    All Memory Cards will automatically be placed in /wiisxrx/saves
    All Savestates will automatically be placed in /wiisxrx/savestates
 * For DVD: ISOs may be anywhere on the disc (requires DVDxV2 on Wii)
 * For actual BIOS: Put SCPH1001.BIN in the directory on SD/USB named /wiisxrx/bios
